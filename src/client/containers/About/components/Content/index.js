        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        Terpene Station Portland made history October 1st 2016 as the FIRST OLCC licensed and operating recreational retail store ever in the State of Oregon. Thank you and congratulations to our Portland team for making that happen! <br /><br />
        
        What does this mean for you? <br /><br />
        
        You can purchase more and it will cost you less.  <br /><br />
        
        As an OLCC licensed retailer we are able to offer our customers up to 28 grams of flower for purchase in a business day; As well as up to 16 oz. of edibles containing up to 50 mg of THC per product, and up to 5 grams of concentrates. And the State tax has been reduced from 25% down to 20%. <br /><br />

        We would like to take an opportunity to thank you for your continued patience while we try to navigate these confusing times in the cannabis industry. New testing requirements from both the State & OLCC have made it very difficult for us to obtain new inventory. We will be bringing in new products as quickly as possible. <br /><br />
